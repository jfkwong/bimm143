# PDB Statistics

The PDB is the main database 

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:

```{r}
db<-read.csv("PDB stats.csv")
db
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray.total<-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",db$X.ray)))
em.total<-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",db$EM)))
```

Write a function for the above components.
```{r}
# I will work with 'x' as input.

sum_comma <- function(x) {
  # Substitute the comma and convert to numeric
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

```

For Xray:
```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

For EM:
```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB? SKIPPED this question, instead inserted picture from molstar.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low of a resolution to see H atoms. A sub 1 Angstrom resolution is needed to see Hydrogen.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb<-read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1 or HOH

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 (A & B)


# Predicting functional motions

Read an ADK structure
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis)

```{r}
# Perform flexibilty prediction 
m<-nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
Write out a "movie" of the motion for viewing in Molstar
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
