# Comparative Analysis of ADK

ADK (Adenylate Kinase) is an important drug target and we want to know how it works - i.e. molecular mechanism.

There has been lots of work done on this protein due to its importance including lots of crystal structures.

We will begin with getting an example ADK sequence from the database. 
We will then use this to find all ADK structures in the PDB.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

aa<-get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

We can now run BLAST with this sequence

```{r}
#b<-blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
#hits<-plot(b)
```

Let's see what is in our `hits` object.

```{r}
#hits$pdb.id

hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

Now we can download all these PDB structure files:

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Now I want to align and supperpose these structures which are all over the palce.

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs

pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```


Let's have a look at our `pdbs` object:

```{r}
pdbs
```
Now we have our aligned and superposed structures we can perform all sorts of analysis on them. Let's do PCA...

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

Results of PCA on Adenylate kinase X-ray structures. Each dot represents one PDB structure.

We can cluster the structures by RMSD (or any other method).

```{r}
rd<-rmsd(pdbs)

hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col=grps)
```



We can make a movie - also called a trajectory of the major differences (i.e. structural displacements) of ADK.

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
